# 📸 Fisheye

**A modern React remake of a fictional photography showcase platform for freelance artists.**  
Created in 2023 as part of my front-end development studies.

---

## 🌟 Overview
Fisheye is a concept platform that allows freelance photographers to showcase their work and connect with potential clients.  

Each photographer has a dedicated profile page featuring their details, a contact form, and a dynamic gallery to display their photos and videos in full-screen mode. Users can browse through portfolios, like their favorite content, and sort media by popularity or date.

Originally built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project was **remade with React, Redux, and Sass** to explore scalable component structures, modular styling, and improved accessibility.
